# Inefficient Recursive Fibonacci
This example demonstrates a common error in recursive function design: redundant calculations. The provided Python function calculates Fibonacci numbers recursively but suffers from exponential time complexity because it recalculates many values multiple times.

The solution showcases a more efficient approach using dynamic programming or memoization.
